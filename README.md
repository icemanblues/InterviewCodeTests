# InterviewCodeTests

There are two types of coding test contained within this repo.
The first are `code proficiency tests` which are actually take-home assignments received over the years.
The questions have been slightly modified to protect all parties involved.
The second are good coding tests for praticing different `algorithmic techniques`.
These are the norm you'll see on hacker rank, leet code, qualified, etc.
