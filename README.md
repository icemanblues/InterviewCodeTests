# InterviewCodeTests

There are two types of coding test contained within this repo.
The first are `code proficiency tests` which are actually take-home assignments received over the years.
The questions have been slightly modified to protect all parties involved.
The second are good coding tests for praticing different `algorithmic techniques`.
These are the norm you'll see on hacker rank, leet code, qualified, etc.

## Coding Proficiency Tests

Each question has a time limit of 1 hour.

* Array Fun
* Connected Cities
* Copy File
* Jumble Sort

## Algorithmic Techniques

Each of these questions, I've tackled in my favorite programming languages.
I keep them as core as possible (no external dependencies).
I also try to keep them to one or two files (per language). One for the algorithm and the other for tests.

* n Queens
* Fibonacci
* Sudoku Solver

## Favorite Programming Languages

For most of these, since they are one file and have no external dependencies, they can be run directly using the below commands. Assuming `Algo` is the name of the algorthimic technique we want to run.

* Go (golang)  
`go run algo.go`
* Python  
`python algo.py`
* Java  
`javac Algo.java && java Algo`

For some of take home assignments, those are closer to proper java projects, and will involve gradle/ maven and be a little on the larger side

Enjoy!
