# Target Sum

## Problem Statement

Given an array containing integers and a target value (integer).
Find two numbers in the array that sum up to the target value and return their indices.

You can assume that there will be a valid solution and exactly one solution for the given arrays and targets.

## Example

Given array `[1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11]` and target value `9`

The answer should be indices (1,4) or (4,1)

The numbers `2` and `7` in the array sum up to the target value of `9`  
Their respective indices are `1` and `4`

```
[1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11]
    ^        ^
    1        4
```
