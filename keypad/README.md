# Keypad

## Problem Statement

Looking at a phone's keypad, we can see that the numbers are mapped to a few letters. Please write a function that will accept an ordered collection of numbers. And the function will return all possible alphabetical characters that those numbers could map to.

These possible alphabetical words do not have to be real words that exist in the dictionary. Just an enumeration of all possible combinations that are possible given the keypad

## Examples

Given the numbers `23`, we should have `9` possible words available from the keypad.

2 maps to the letters a,b,c  
3 maps to the letters d,e,f

All outcomes:

1. ad
1. ae
1. af
1. bd
1. be
1. bf
1. cd
1. ce
1. cf
